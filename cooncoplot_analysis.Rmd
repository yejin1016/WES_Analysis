# Load library
```{r}
library(maftools)
```

## Below is to use co-oncoplot on primary tumor and lymph nodes
# Manually list the PT and LN
```{r}
PT_list = list("list of primary tumor maf files")
LN_list = list("list of lymph node maf files")
```

# Merge PT and LN separately
```{r}
PT_loaded = merge_mafs(lapply(PT_list, read.maf))
LN_loaded = merge_mafs(lapply(LN_list, read.maf))
```

# Plot co-oncoplot to compare PT and LN
```{r}
png("/path/to/plots/PT_vs_LN.png", width = 600, height = 400, unit = "px")
coOncoplot(PT_loaded, LN_loaded, m1Name = "Primary Tumor", m2Name = "Lymph Node")
```

## Below is to use co-oncoplot on lymph node metastasis group and no metastasis group
# Manually list the LNM and no-LNM
```{r}
LNM_list = list("list of lymph node metastasized sample maf files")

no_LNM_list = list("list of no metastasized sample maf files")
```

# Merge LNM and no-LNM separately
```{r}
LNM_loaded = merge_mafs(lapply(LNM_list, read.maf))
no_LNM_loaded = merge_mafs(lapply(no_LNM_list, read.maf))
```

# Plot co-oncoplot to compare LNM and no-LNM
```{r}
png("/path/to/plots/LNM_vs_noLNM.png", width = 600, height = 400, unit = "px")
coOncoplot(m1 = LNM_loaded, m2 = no_LNM_loaded, m1Name = "LNM Group", m2Name = "No-LNM Group")
```
